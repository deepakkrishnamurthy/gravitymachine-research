# Scale-free Vertical Tracking Microscopy (a.k.a) Gravity Machine
For sharing the design, software and firmware of the Scale-free Vertical Tracking Microscope (a.k.a Gravity Machine) developed by Krishnamurthy et al.: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/610246v1. More details coming soon.
Code for viewing data collected using the microscope can be found here along with other analysis scripts. 

This is a joint effort with the octopi(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/684423v1) (open configurable high-throughput imaging platform) designed for research use. This repo can also be used as a template for building general open-source tracking microscopy platforms (for instance built on the octopi).

We are currently in the process of migrating the code to a new code-base which will serve as a general template for open-source tracking microscopy platforms. *Stay tuned for upcoming releases!*
