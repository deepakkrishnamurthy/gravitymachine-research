# Gravity Machine - 
For sharing the design, software and firmware of the Scale-free Vertical Tracking Microscope (a.k.a Gravity Machine) developed by Krishnamurthy et al.: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/610246v1. This is a joint effort with the octopi(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/684423v1) (open configurable high-throughput imaging platform) designed for research use. This repo can also be used as a template for building general open-source tracking microscopy platforms (for instance built on the octopi).
