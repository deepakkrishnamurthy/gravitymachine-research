# SQUID-Tracking: Tracking microscopy for everyone

SQUID is a open-hardware and open-software modular microscopy platform. This repo contains the modules for the tracking microscopy feature of SQUID. Tracking and other modules are derived and extended from Scale-free Vertical Tracking Microscopy (a.k.a Gravity Machine) developed by Krishnamurthy et al.: [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0924-7), [Biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/610246v1).
