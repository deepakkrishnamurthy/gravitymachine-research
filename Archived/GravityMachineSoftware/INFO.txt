Adding OpenCV object tracker suite to improve the robustness of tracking: DONE
Added 8 OpenCV trackers for single object in addition to the nearest neighbhour tracking that was already present.

2018_12_13
Tested the code with the new trackers and the code is working fine. Will test with actual organisms tomorrow



2018_12_13:

To DO:
Add GUI control of the tracker type. 

Modify certain GUI elements to expand the range of parameter varibales. Such as saving images at less than 1 FPS.

Check the PID code which definitely seems to have some bug that causes oscillations even when the all P, I , D are turned to Zero.


2018_12_15:

To Do: Add functionality to control light intensity as a function of virtual depth.

Also record the measured light intensity using a photodetector.

2018_12_16:

Added Light intensity control and measurement functionality.
